The cellulose/chitin acts as a 3D scaffold, guiding the Mg3(PO4)2 precipitation and creating a porous network for electrolyte access.  Furthermore, the bio-template's inherent biodegradability makes end-of-life recycling significantly easier.",

However, its poor electrical conductivity and volume changes during cycling limit its use. Bio-templates offer a pathway to control morphology and alleviate these issues. The porous structure enhances electrolyte access, while the template itself might contribute to a self-healing mechanism by reacting with degraded material. Cellulosic and chitinous matrices are also inherently recyclable/compostable.",

However, its poor electrical conductivity and volume changes during cycling limit its practical applications. Recent research has focused on improving Mg3(PO4)2 properties through nanostructuring, doping, and composite formations. Bio-templating has emerged as a promising strategy for controlling the morphology and porosity of materials, enabling enhanced performance in energy storage devices.

The cellulose/chitin acts as a 3D scaffold, guiding the Mg3(PO4)2 precipitation and creating a porous network for electrolyte access.
