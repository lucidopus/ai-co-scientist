**Type:** Feature Request  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `api`, `gemma`, `query-generation`  
**Assignee:** TBD  
**Milestone:** v1.1.0  

## üéØ Objective

Implement an automated query generation system that creates high-quality scientific research queries suitable for testing the AI Co-Scientist hypothesis generation pipeline. This will provide users with example queries that demonstrate the system's capabilities across diverse scientific domains.

## üîß Technical Requirements

### New Endpoint
- **Path:** `GET /sample`
- **Method:** GET
- **Authentication:** Required (API key)
- **Input:** None (no request body)
- **Output:** Generated scientific query with metadata

### Implementation Details

#### 1. New Model Definition
Add to `utils/models.py`:
```python
class SampleQueryResponse(BaseModel):
    query_id: str = Field(description="Unique identifier for the generated query")
    generated_query: str = Field(description="The automatically generated scientific query")
    domain: str = Field(description="Primary scientific domain of the query")
    complexity_level: str = Field(description="Complexity level: basic/intermediate/advanced")
    estimated_hypotheses: int = Field(description="Estimated number of hypotheses this query could generate")
    generation_metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(description="Metadata about the generation process")
    timestamp: datetime = Field(description="When the query was generated")
```

#### 2. Query Generation Prompt
Add to `prompts.py` in the `AgentPrompts` class:
```python
QUERY_GENERATION_AGENT = """You are a scientific query generation agent for an AI Co-Scientist system. Your role is to create diverse, high-quality scientific research queries that can generate meaningful hypotheses.

QUERY GENERATION GUIDELINES:
1. **Diversity**: Generate queries across different scientific domains (biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, medicine, environmental science, etc.)
2. **Specificity**: Create focused, well-defined research questions that can lead to testable hypotheses
3. **Novelty**: Focus on emerging areas, interdisciplinary approaches, and cutting-edge challenges
4. **Feasibility**: Ensure queries can be addressed with current or near-future technology
5. **Impact**: Prioritize queries with potential for significant scientific or societal impact
6. **Clarity**: Write clear, unambiguous questions that researchers can understand and build upon

QUERY STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- Start with a clear research question or challenge
- Include specific constraints, focus areas, or methodologies when relevant
- Mention practical considerations (cost, time, equipment, etc.) when appropriate
- Specify target applications or outcomes when beneficial
- Use precise scientific terminology while remaining accessible

DOMAIN EXAMPLES:
- **Biomedical**: "How can we develop targeted therapies for rare genetic disorders using CRISPR-based approaches?"
- **Materials Science**: "What novel composite materials could improve energy storage efficiency in electric vehicles?"
- **Environmental**: "How can we design bio-inspired filtration systems for microplastic removal from water sources?"
- **AI/ML**: "Can we develop interpretable machine learning models for predicting protein folding intermediates?"
- **Energy**: "What innovative approaches could enable scalable fusion energy production using alternative confinement methods?"

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a single high-quality query in this JSON structure:
{
  "generated_query": "Complete scientific research question with context and constraints",
  "domain": "Primary scientific domain (e.g., 'Biomedical', 'Materials Science', 'Environmental Science')",
  "subdomain": "Specific subfield (e.g., 'Genetic Engineering', 'Energy Storage', 'Water Treatment')",
  "complexity_level": "basic/intermediate/advanced",
  "estimated_hypotheses": 3-8,
  "key_concepts": ["concept1", "concept2", "concept3"],
  "research_approach": "Brief description of likely research methodology",
  "potential_impact": "Expected scientific or societal impact",
  "feasibility_factors": ["factor1", "factor2"],
  "interdisciplinary_elements": ["field1", "field2"]
}

Generate one diverse, high-quality scientific query that would be excellent for testing hypothesis generation capabilities."""
```

    Returns:
        dict: Generated query with metadata
