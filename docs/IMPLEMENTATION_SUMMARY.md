# AI Co-Scientist Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project implements a complete AI Co-Scientist system using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) with a sophisticated multi-agent architecture. The system generates, critiques, refines, and ranks novel scientific hypotheses using multiple state-of-the-art language models.

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent System Design

The AI Co-Scientist employs six specialized agents working in a coordinated pipeline:

1. **Generation Agent** (Gemma 3 12B)
   - Generates novel scientific hypotheses
   - Uses creative generation strategy
   - Produces diverse, innovative research directions

2. **Proximity Agent** (Gemma 2 9B-IT)
   - Retrieves related knowledge and context
   - Grounds hypotheses in existing research
   - Identifies knowledge gaps and opportunities

3. **Reflection Agent** (OpenAI o3-mini)
   - Critically evaluates hypotheses
   - Provides detailed critique and scoring
   - Assesses validity, novelty, feasibility, and impact

4. **Ranking Agent** (Gemma 2 9B-IT)
   - Ranks hypotheses using weighted criteria
   - Provides comparative analysis
   - Fast processing for ranking tasks

5. **Evolution Agent** (Llama 3.3 70B-Versatile)
   - Iteratively refines top hypotheses
   - Implements mutation, combination, and improvement strategies
   - Uses complex reasoning for sophisticated refinements

6. **Meta-Review Agent** (OpenAI o3-mini)
   - Performs final comprehensive review
   - Creates detailed experimental plans
   - Provides actionable research recommendations
